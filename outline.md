* Exploring the furry fandom
    * I'm Makyo
    * Write for \[adjective\]\[species\] along with Klisoura the coyote, the awesome JM, an Australian horse in the UK, and a few others.
    * Want to talk about exploring furry through data
* Why?
* Furry is interesting
    * Growing fast
        * How to estimate growth - responses vs. convention attendance
        * Growth over the last five years
    * No membership requirements
    * Spans boundaries
* There's a lot to explore
    * Understanding individual aspects
    * Understanding change over time
    * Making sense of the fandom as a whole
* So what is exploring?
* Collection
    * First we need to collect information
    * Two main resources
    * Surveys and spelunking for outside data
    * Introspection for inside data
* Understanding
    * Looking through data
    * Searching for stories
    * Verifying against other sources
    * Deciding on interesting points
* Giving back
    * Data presentation
    * Data visualization
    * Data accessibility
    * Data description
* Dialog
    * Sharing - social currency
    * Commenting
    * Differing opinions
    * What's missing
* Explore cycle
    * Exploration is really a cycle
    * Collect data
    * Piece it together into a story
    * Pull it into a presentable format
    * Start a dialog
    * Learn what/where/how to collect next time
* For example
    * Here's a small example of a story told through data
    * JM wanted to explore how furry might help one re-evaluate their sexual preference
    * Collected pertinent data to work with - years in the fandom correlated with sexual orientation
    * Trend was visible
    * Pulled into a vis (slide)
    * Started dialog with article (slide)
    * Learn where to go next
* What do we have to work with?
    * Gerbasi et al.
    * Anthropomorphic research project
    * The Furry Survey
    * \[a\]\[s\]
    * Some others
    * Introspection, but will get into that later
* What have we learned so far?
    * Quite a bit, really
    * Diverse fandom in some ways, not others
    * Growing fandom
    * Problems with our own definition
    * But that's okay, leads to looser membership "requirements"
* Before I continue...
    * Want everyone to pay attention to something
    * I am going to talk about the following things:
        * age
        * race
        * sex and gender
        * sexual orientation
        * relationship status
        * importance of sex
    * Pay attention to your own reaction
    * Look around you and see how this compares to what you observe.
    * What is surprising and new?
    * What did you already expect was the case?
    * Will explain why this is important after.
* Age
    * Not too surprising that furry is young
    * Still a long tail
    * Does this also imply that there's a drop-out age?
* Race
    * Far and away white
    * Fairly stable over time, but slowly diversifying
    * What sort of story could lead to this data?
* Sex and Gender
    * Wide gap here
    * The 80-20 numbers are telling
    * Ties in with the next slide
* Orientation
    * Kind of heartening
    * Oft-quoted 10%
    * More even spread along kinsey scale
    * Tie in with last slide: large number of same-sex relationships due to the skewed gender numbers (i.e.: many who identify as bi wind up in same-sex relationships)
* Relationship status
    * While we're on the subject...
    * Explain the graphs
        * Relationship status: more single than perhaps expected
        * Polyamory - sexual and romantic (2013): more open sexually than romantically; how does this compare to the world at large?
        * Partner is a furry (5yr mean): maybe surprising that respondents often have non-furry partners
* The importance of sex
    * Perhaps a little surprising?
    * Explaination of the four graphs:
        * importance to respondent. Not terribly important
        * perceived importance to rest of fandom. More important than self
        * perceived importance to fandom as a whole. Similar.
        * perceived importance to fandom by public. Big difference
    * What does this say?
    * Are we really crazy sexual, or are we just defensive about sexuality?
* Doxa and Introspection
    * What is doxa?
    * What we accept as truth without needing proof, common belief and judgement
    * What is the doxa within the fandom?
    * Look at the data:
    * What is intuitive?
    * What is surprising?
* Letting go of doxa
    * Sometimes necessary to let go of an idea
    * Can be difficult to do, but necesssary
    * For example, wanted to explore average charity donation per con attendee
    * Expected donation/attendee to increase as attendance increased due to social aspect of giving
    * Reality is more complicated (slide)
    * Total donations have increased, but donations aren't just from attendees (slide)
    * Have to let go of a concept in order to get down to the truth of things
* Where do we go from here?
    * This was part of our dialog
    * There's a lot of data (slide)
    * Needs to be sorted, stories need to be found (slide)
    * What do we need to collect? (slide)
    * Where can studies be improved?
    * Where can we gain more information?
* (Open for questions)
