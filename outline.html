                <li>Want to talk about exploring furry through data</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Why?</li>
            <li>Furry is interesting<ul>
                <li>Growing fast<ul>
                    <li>How to estimate growth - responses vs. convention attendance</li>
                    <li>Growth over the last five years</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>No membership requirements</li>
                <li>Spans boundaries</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>There's a lot to explore<ul>
                <li>Understanding individual aspects</li>
                <li>Understanding change over time</li>
                <li>Making sense of the fandom as a whole</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>So what is exploring?</li>
            <li>Collection<ul>
                <li>First we need to collect information</li>
                <li>Two main resources</li>
                <li>Surveys and spelunking for outside data</li>
                <li>Introspection for inside data</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Understanding<ul>
                <li>Looking through data</li>
                <li>Searching for stories</li>
                <li>Verifying against other sources</li>
                <li>Deciding on interesting points</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Giving back<ul>
                <li>Data presentation</li>
                <li>Data visualization</li>
                <li>Data accessibility</li>
                <li>Data description</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dialog<ul>
                <li>Sharing - social currency</li>
                <li>Commenting</li>
                <li>Differing opinions</li>
                <li>What's missing</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Explore cycle<ul>
                <li>Exploration is really a cycle</li>
                <li>Collect data</li>
                <li>Piece it together into a story</li>
                <li>Pull it into a presentable format</li>
                <li>Start a dialog</li>
                <li>Learn what/where/how to collect next time</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For example<ul>
                <li>Here's a small example of a story told through data</li>
                <li>JM wanted to explore how furry might help one re-evaluate their sexual preference</li>
                <li>Collected pertinent data to work with - years in the fandom correlated with sexual orientation</li>
                <li>Trend was visible</li>
                <li>Pulled into a vis (slide)</li>
                <li>Started dialog with article (slide)</li>
                <li>Learn where to go next</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What do we have to work with?<ul>
                <li>Gerbasi et al.</li>
                <li>Anthropomorphic research project</li>
                <li>The Furry Survey</li>
                <li>[a][s]</li>
                <li>Some others</li>
                <li>Introspection, but will get into that later</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What have we learned so far?<ul>
                <li>Quite a bit, really</li>
                <li>Diverse fandom in some ways, not others</li>
                <li>Growing fandom</li>
                <li>Problems with our own definition</li>
                <li>But that's okay, leads to looser membership "requirements"</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Before I continue...<ul>
                <li>Want everyone to pay attention to something</li>
                <li>I am going to talk about the following things:<ul>
                    <li>age</li>
                    <li>race</li>
                    <li>sex and gender</li>
                    <li>sexual orientation</li>
                    <li>relationship status</li>
                    <li>importance of sex</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Pay attention to your own reaction</li>
                <li>Look around you and see how this compares to what you observe.</li>
                <li>What is surprising and new?</li>
                <li>What did you already expect was the case?</li>
                <li>Will explain why this is important after.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Age<ul>
                <li>Not too surprising that furry is young</li>
                <li>Still a long tail</li>
                <li>Does this also imply that there's a drop-out age?</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Race<ul>
                <li>Far and away white</li>
                <li>Fairly stable over time, but slowly diversifying</li>
                <li>What sort of story could lead to this data?</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sex and Gender<ul>
                <li>Wide gap here</li>
                <li>The 80-20 numbers are telling</li>
                <li>Ties in with the next slide</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Orientation<ul>
                <li>Kind of heartening</li>
                <li>Oft-quoted 10%</li>
                <li>More even spread along kinsey scale</li>
                <li>Tie in with last slide: large number of same-sex relationships due to the skewed gender numbers (i.e.: many who identify as bi wind up in same-sex relationships)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Relationship status<ul>
                <li>While we're on the subject...</li>
                <li>Explain the graphs<ul>
                    <li>Relationship status: more single than perhaps expected</li>
                    <li>Polyamory - sexual and romantic (2013): more open sexually than romantically; how does this compare to the world at large?</li>
                    <li>Partner is a furry (5yr mean): maybe surprising that respondents often have non-furry partners</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The importance of sex<ul>
                <li>Perhaps a little surprising?</li>
                <li>Explaination of the four graphs:<ul>
                    <li>importance to respondent. Not terribly important</li>
                    <li>perceived importance to rest of fandom. More important than self</li>
                    <li>perceived importance to fandom as a whole. Similar.</li>
                    <li>perceived importance to fandom by public. Big difference</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What does this say?</li>
                <li>Are we really crazy sexual, or are we just defensive about sexuality?</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Doxa and Introspection<ul>
                <li>What is doxa?</li>
                <li>What we accept as truth without needing proof, common belief and judgement</li>
                <li>What is the doxa within the fandom?</li>
                <li>Look at the data:</li>
                <li>What is intuitive?</li>
                <li>What is surprising?</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Letting go of doxa<ul>
                <li>Sometimes necessary to let go of an idea</li>
                <li>Can be difficult to do, but necesssary</li>
                <li>For example, wanted to explore average charity donation per con attendee</li>
                <li>Expected donation/attendee to increase as attendance increased due to social aspect of giving</li>
                <li>Reality is more complicated (slide)</li>
                <li>Total donations have increased, but donations aren't just from attendees (slide)</li>
                <li>Have to let go of a concept in order to get down to the truth of things</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Where do we go from here?<ul>
                <li>This was part of our dialog</li>
                <li>There's a lot of data (slide)</li>
                <li>Needs to be sorted, stories need to be found (slide)</li>
                <li>What do we need to collect? (slide)</li>
                <li>Where can studies be improved?</li>
                <li>Where can we gain more information?</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>(Open for questions)</li>
        </ul>
